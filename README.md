Once upon a time, I was thinking about tetris grid and how to code it with arrays. The point is, I'm not a developer so I asked my friend how would he code it. After that he asked me multiple times have I already coded a tetris or haven't. And every time my answer was - I haven't cause I don't know any languages.

As you know a couple months ago pandemic hit the World and I decided to read some articles about JavaScript while was staying home. I tried to study it before, but started from the beginning. And today when I got some knowledge about js syntax, I am going to code my tetris with JavaScript.

My fried doesn't know about it and I hope so he won't know about it until the end.

Have a good
